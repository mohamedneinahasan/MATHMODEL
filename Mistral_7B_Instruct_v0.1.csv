Answer: 10 meters by 15 meters.

Explanation: 

Let's denote the length of the room as L and the width as W.

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W.

In this case, the perimeter is 50 meters, so we have the equation:
50 = 2L + 2W

We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = LW.

In this case, the area is 150 square meters, so we have the equation:

Answer: The dimensions of the rectangle are 20 meters in length and 10 meters in width.
Explanation: Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2L + 2W. In this case, the perimeter is 60 meters. 
We also know that the length is twice the width, so L = 2W.

1. We know that Pipe A and Pipe B can fill the tank together in 6 hours.
2. We also know that Pipe A can fill the tank alone in 9 hours.
3. Since Pipe A can fill the tank alone in 9 hours, Pipe B must be able to fill the tank alone in 9 hours as well (because they work at the same rate when working together).
