1,John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more each day. How many after 4 days?,17 apples,"Day 1: 5 + 3 = 8 apples
Day 2: 8 + 3 = 11 apples
Day 3: 11 + 3 = 14 apples
Day 4: 14 + 3 = 17 apples","Solve the following math problem: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more each day. How many after 4 days?
Answer: To find the total number of apples after 4 days, we need to add the number of apples John has each day. 
On the first day, John has 5 apples. 
On the second day, he buys 3 more, so he has 5 + 3 = 8 apples. 
On the third day, he buys 3 more, so he has 8 + 3 = 11 apples. 
On the fourth day, he buys 3 more, so he has 11 + 3 = 14 apples.

Answer: Let's call the number of apples that Mary has ""x"". Then, John has ""x + 5"" apples. We know that together they have 30 apples, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x + 5) = 30
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x + 5 = 30
Subtracting 5 from both sides, we get:
2x = 25

6,"A solution contains 30% sugar. If there are 5 liters of solution, how much sugar is in the solution?",1.5 liters of sugar,Amount of sugar = 30% of 5 liters = 0.3 * 5 = 1.5 liters,"Solve the following math problem: A solution contains 30% sugar. If there are 5 liters of solution, how much sugar is in the solution?
Answer: To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of sugar in the solution. 

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of sugar in the solution
Since the solution contains 30% sugar, we can express this as a decimal by dividing 30 by 100: 30/100 = 0.3

Step 2: Multiply the percentage by the total volume of the solution
To find the amount of sugar in the solution, we multiply the percentage (0.3) by the total volume (5 liters): 0.3 * 5 = 1.5

Therefore, there is 1.5 liters of sugar",Mixture Problems,Medium

Answer: To find the number of boys and girls, we can first find the total parts in the ratio. The total parts are 3 (for boys) + 5 (for girls) = 8 parts.
Next, we can divide the total number of students by the total parts in the ratio. This gives us 64 students / 8 parts = 8 students per part.
Now, we can multiply the number of students per part by the number of parts for each group. For boys, there are 3 parts, so 8 students per part * 3 parts = 24 boys. For girls, there are 5 parts, so 8 students per part * 5 parts = 40 girls",Ratio and Proportion Problems,Hard

Answer: Let's assume that the time it takes for the two machines to complete the task working together is represented by $t$ hours. The rate at which the first machine completes the task is $\frac{1}{12}$ of the task per hour, and the rate at which the second machine completes the task is $\frac{1}{16}$ of the task per hour. When working together, their rates are additive, so we can write the equation $\frac{1}{12} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{1}{t}$.

Simplifying the equation, we get:
xt - 3t = 18t
xt = 21t
x = 21/t
We also know that the distance traveled upstream is the same as the distance traveled downstream, so we can set up another equation:

97,"A box contains 20 chocolates, 12 are dark chocolate. What fraction of the chocolates are not dark chocolate?",2/5,"Number of non-dark chocolates = 20 - 12 = 8
Fraction not dark = 8 / 20 = 2/5","Solve the following math problem: A box contains 20 chocolates, 12 are dark chocolate. What fraction of the chocolates are not dark chocolate?
Answer: To find the fraction of chocolates that are not dark chocolate, we need to subtract the number of dark chocolates from the total number of chocolates and then divide by the total number of chocolates. 

Total chocolates = 20
Number of dark chocolates = 12
Number of chocolates that are not dark chocolate = 20 - 12 = 8

Fraction of chocolates that are not dark chocolate = 8/20 = 2/5

Therefore, the answer is 2/5.",Fractions,Easy
98,A car can travel 300 miles on 10 gallons of gas. How many miles can it travel on 25 gallons?,750 miles,"Miles per gallon = 300 miles / 10 gallons = 30 miles/gallon
Distance = 30 miles/gallon * 25 gallons = 750 miles","Solve the following math problem: A car can travel 300 miles on 10 gallons of gas. How many miles can it travel on 25 gallons?
Answer: To find the number of miles the car can travel on 25 gallons of gas, we need to set up a proportion using the given information.

Let's denote the number of miles the car can travel on 25 gallons as ""x"". The proportion can be set up as:

300 miles / 10 gallons = x miles / 25 gallons

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

10 * x = 300 * 25

Simplifying the equation, we have:

10x = 7500

Dividing both sides of the equation by 10,",Distance-Rate-Time,Medium
99,"A restaurant bill is $120. If you want to leave a 15% tip, how much should you leave?",$18,Tip = 15% of $120 = 0.15 * 120 = $18,"Solve the following math problem: A restaurant bill is $120. If you want to leave a 15% tip, how much should you leave?
Answer: To calculate the tip, we need to find 15% of the bill amount. We can do this by multiplying the bill amount by 0.15 (or 15/100). 
15% of $120 = 0.15 x $120 = $18
Therefore, the amount of the tip should be $18.
The answer is $18.",Percentage Problems,Easy
100,"A package weighs 8 pounds. If you want to divide it into 4 equal parts, how much does each part weigh?",2 pounds,Weight per part = 8 pounds / 4 = 2 pounds,"Solve the following math problem: A package weighs 8 pounds. If you want to divide it into 4 equal parts, how much does each part weigh?
Answer: To find the weight of each part, we need to divide the total weight of the package (8 pounds) by the number of parts (4).
8 pounds ÷ 4 = 2 pounds
Therefore, each part weighs 2 pounds.
The answer is 2 pounds.",Division,Easy
