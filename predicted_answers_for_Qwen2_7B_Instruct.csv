Day 3: 11 + 3 = 14 apples
Day 4: 14 + 3 = 17 apples","Solve the following math problem: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more each day. How many after 4 days?
Answer: After 4 days, John will have 20 apples.

Here's the calculation:
- Day 1: John starts with 5 apples.
- Day 2: He buys 3 more, so he has \(5 + 3 = 8\) apples.
- Day 3: He buys another 3, making it \(8 + 3 = 11\) apples.
- Day 4: He buys yet another 3, bringing his total to \(11 + 3 = 14\) apples.

Therefore, by the end of the fourth day, John will have 14 apples, not 20 as initially stated in the answer. The correct answer should be 14 apples.",Simple Equations,Easy,2

Answer: It will take them approximately 2.4 hours to paint the wall together.

Explanation:
To solve this problem, we first determine how much of the wall each person can paint in one hour. 

John paints 1/4 of the wall per hour, and Mary paints 1/6 of the wall per hour. Together, they paint (1/4 + 1/6) of the wall per hour.

Let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 12:

Answer: Jessica starts with 8 oranges. Every day, she buys an additional 5 oranges. To find out how many oranges she will have after 3 days, we calculate the total number of oranges she buys over those 3 days and add it to her initial amount.

Total oranges bought in 3 days = \(5 \times 3 = 15\)

If a student buys 5 notebooks and 4 pens, how much does the student spend?",$23,Total cost = (5 * 3) + (4 * 2) = 15 + 8 = $23,"Solve the following math problem: A store sells notebooks for $3 each and pens for $2 each. If a student buys 5 notebooks and 4 pens, how much does the student spend?
Answer: The student spends $17.

Explanation:
To find out how much the student spends, you need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the pens separately and then add them together.

For the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $3.
- The student buys 5 notebooks.
So, the total cost for notebooks = 5 notebooks * $3/notebook = $15.

For the pens:
- Each pen costs $2.
- The student buys 4 pens.
So, the total cost for pens = 4 pens * $2/pen = $8.

Now, add the total cost of the notebooks and the pens to find the total amount spent:
Total amount spent = Total cost for notebooks + Total cost for pens",Simple Operations,Easy,1
90,"A box can hold 48 items. If each item takes up 3 cubic inches, what is the total volume of the box?",144 cubic inches,Total volume = 48 items * 3 cubic inches/item = 144 cubic inches,"Solve the following math problem: A box can hold 48 items. If each item takes up 3 cubic inches, what is the total volume of the box?
Answer: The total volume of the box is \(144\) cubic inches.

Step-by-step explanation:
To find the total volume of the box, we need to consider both the capacity in terms of the number of items it can hold and the space each item occupies.

Given that:
- The box can hold \(48\) items.
- Each item takes up \(3\) cubic inches.

The total volume of the box can be calculated by multiplying the number of items by the volume each item occupies:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = \text{Number of Items} \times \text{Volume per Item} \]

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 48 \times 3 \]

Answer: 10 cups of flour are needed for 5 loaves of bread.

To find out how much flour is needed for 5 loaves, you can set up a proportion based on the given information:

For 2 loaves: 4 cups of flour
For 5 loaves: x cups of flour

The proportion would be:
\[ \frac{2 \text{ loaves}}{4 \text{ cups}} = \frac{5 \text{ loaves}}{x \text{ cups}} \]

Answer: The length of the third side is 13.

Step-by-step explanation:
Let's denote the sides of the triangle as a, b, and c, with a = 5 and b = 12. We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30. The formula for the perimeter of a triangle is:

\[ P = a + b + c \]

Substituting the given values, we have:

\[ 30 = 5 + 12 + c \]
\[ 30 = 17 + c \]
\[ c = 30 - 17 \]
\[ c = 13 \]

Answer: To find the original number when given that 75% of it equals 60, you can set up an equation based on the information provided. Let's denote the original number as \(x\). 

Given that 75% (or 0.75 in decimal form) of \(x\) is equal to 60, we can write the equation as:
\[0.75x = 60\]

To solve for \(x\), divide both sides by 0.75:
\[x = \frac{60}{0.75}\]

\[x = 80\]

Therefore, the original number is 80.",Percentage Problems,Medium,1

To find the boat's speed upstream, we need to subtract the speed of the current from the boat's speed in still water. 

Given:
- Boat's speed in still water = 15 miles per hour
- Speed of the current = 3 miles per hour

The formula for the boat's speed upstream is:
\[ \text{Boat's speed upstream} = \text{Boat's speed in still water} - \text{Speed of the current} \]

Answer: To find the fraction of chocolates that are not dark chocolate, we first need to determine how many chocolates are not dark chocolate.

We know there are a total of 20 chocolates in the box and 12 of them are dark chocolate. So, the number of chocolates that are not dark chocolate is:

Total chocolates - Dark chocolates = Not dark chocolates
20 - 12 = 8

So, there are 8 chocolates that are not dark chocolate.

Now, to find the fraction of chocolates that are not dark chocolate, we divide the number of not dark chocolates by the total number of chocolates:

Fraction of not dark chocolate = Number of not dark chocolates / Total number of chocolates

Tip Percentage (decimal) = 15 / 100 = 0.15

Now, multiply the bill by the decimal form of the tip percentage:

Tip = $120 × 0.15 = $18

So, you should leave a $18 tip. To find the total amount to pay, add the bill and the tip together:
