2,A pen costs $2. How much will 4 pens cost?,$8,4 pens * $2/pen = $8,"Solve the following math problem: A pen costs $2. How much will 4 pens cost?
Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to determine the cost of one pen. We are given that one pen costs $2.

Next, we want to find out how much 4 pens will cost. To do this, we need to multiply the cost of one pen by the number of pens we want to buy. In this case, we want to buy 4 pens.

So, we can set up the equation as follows:

Cost of 1 pen × Number of pens = Total cost of pens

3,"Tom is 5 years younger than Jane. If Jane is 12, how old is Tom?",7 years old,Tom = Jane's age - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7,"Solve the following math problem: Tom is 5 years younger than Jane. If Jane is 12, how old is Tom?
Answer: First, we need to understand the relationship between Tom and Jane's ages. The problem states that Tom is 5 years younger than Jane. 

Second, we are given Jane's age, which is 12 years old. 

To find Tom's age, we need to subtract 5 years from Jane's age because Tom is 5 years younger. 

So, the calculation would be: 12 (Jane's age) - 5 (the age difference) = 7. 

Therefore, Tom is 7 years old. 

In conclusion, Tom is 7 years old.

4,A car travels at 30 miles per hour. How far does it travel in 2 hours?,60 miles,Distance = Speed * Time = 30 miles/hour * 2 hours = 60 miles,"Solve the following math problem: A car travels at 30 miles per hour. How far does it travel in 2 hours?
Answer: First, we need to understand the problem. The problem is asking us to find the distance traveled by a car in 2 hours, given that the car travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for distance, which is:

Distance = Speed * Time

In this case, the speed is 30 miles per hour and the time is 2 hours. So, we can substitute these values into the formula:

Answer:The total number of marbles in the bag is 10 + 6 + 4 = 20.
The probability of drawing a blue marble is 6/20, since there are 6 blue marbles out of 20 total marbles.
The probability of not drawing a blue marble is 1 - (6/20), since the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1.
Therefore, the probability of not drawing a blue marble is (20 - 6)/20 = 14/20 = 7/10.

The answer is: \frac{7}{10}.",Probability,Medium,1
88,A cyclist travels 24 miles in 2 hours. What is the average speed in miles per hour?,12 miles per hour,Average speed = Distance / Time = 24 miles / 2 hours = 12 miles/hour,"Solve the following math problem: A cyclist travels 24 miles in 2 hours. What is the average speed in miles per hour?
Answer: To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken. In this case, the cyclist travels 24 miles in 2 hours. So, we can calculate the average speed as follows:

Step 1: Write down the formula for average speed: Average speed = Total distance / Total time

Step 2: Plug in the given values into the formula: Average speed = 24 miles / 2 hours

Step 3: Perform the division: 24 miles / 2 hours = 12 miles per hour

If each item takes up 3 cubic inches, what is the total volume of the box?",144 cubic inches,Total volume = 48 items * 3 cubic inches/item = 144 cubic inches,"Solve the following math problem: A box can hold 48 items. If each item takes up 3 cubic inches, what is the total volume of the box?
Answer: To find the total volume of the box, we need to multiply the number of items it can hold by the volume of each item.

Step 1: Determine the volume of one item.
We know that each item takes up 3 cubic inches, so the volume of one item is 3 cubic inches.

Step 2: Calculate the total volume of the box.
The box can hold 48 items, so we need to multiply the volume of one item (3 cubic inches) by the number of items the box can hold (48).

92,A recipe requires 4 cups of flour for 2 loaves of bread. How much flour is needed for 5 loaves?,10 cups of flour,"Flour per loaf = 4 cups / 2 loaves = 2 cups/loaf
Flour for 5 loaves = 2 cups/loaf * 5 = 10 cups","Solve the following math problem: A recipe requires 4 cups of flour for 2 loaves of bread. How much flour is needed for 5 loaves?
Answer: First, we need to determine the amount of flour required for one loaf of bread. To do this, we divide the total amount of flour needed for 2 loaves by the number of loaves. That is, 4 cups of flour divided by 2 loaves, which equals 2 cups of flour per loaf.

Next, we need to find out how much flour is needed for 5 loaves. Since we know that 1 loaf requires 2 cups of flour, we can multiply this amount by the number of loaves needed. So, 2 cups of flour per loaf times 5 loaves equals 10 cups of flour.

Therefore, the amount of flour needed",Proportion Problems,Easy,5

Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand what a 10% raise means. A 10% raise means that the person's salary will increase by 10% of their current salary.

Second, we need to calculate what 10% of the person's current salary is. To do this, we multiply the current salary by 10% (or 0.1 in decimal form). 

So, the calculation would be: $50,000 * 0.1 = $5,000.

This means that the person's salary will increase by $5,000.

x = 60 / 0.75 = 80","Solve the following math problem: If 75% of a number is 60, what is the number?
Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to translate the problem into a mathematical equation. The problem states that 75% of a number is equal to 60. In mathematical terms, we can represent the number as $x$ and 75% as $0.75x$. The equation becomes:

$0.75x = 60$

Next, we need to solve for $x$. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

$\frac{0.75x}{0.75} = \frac{60}{0.75}$

If the current is 3 miles per hour, what is the boat's speed upstream?
Answer: Let's think step by step.First, we need to understand the concept of speed in still water and speed against the current. 

The speed of the boat in still water is given as 15 miles per hour. This is the speed at which the boat would travel if there were no current.

The speed of the current is given as 3 miles per hour. This is the speed at which the water is flowing, which affects the boat's speed.

When the boat is traveling against the current, the speed of the current needs to be taken into account. This is because the current is flowing in the opposite direction to the boat, slowing it down.
