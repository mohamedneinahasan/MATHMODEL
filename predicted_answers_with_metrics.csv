1,John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more each day. How many after 4 days?,17 apples,"Day 1: 5 + 3 = 8 apples
Day 2: 8 + 3 = 11 apples
Day 3: 11 + 3 = 14 apples
Day 4: 14 + 3 = 17 apples","Solve the following math problem: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more each day. How many after 4 days?
Answer: To solve this problem, we can use the knowledge point of addition.

On the first day, John has 5 apples.
On the second day, he buys 3 more, so he has 5 + 3 = 8 apples.
On the third day, he buys 3 more, so he has 8 + 3 = 11 apples.
On the fourth day, he buys 3 more, so he has 11 + 3 = 14 apples.

Therefore, after 4 days, John will have 14 apples.

If the current is 3 miles per hour, what is the boat's speed upstream?
Answer: Let the speed of the boat upstream be $x$ miles per hour. Then, the speed of the boat downstream would be $x+3$ miles per hour. We know that the distance traveled is the same in both cases, so we can use the formula $d=rt$, where $d$ is the distance, $r$ is the rate (or speed), and $t$ is the time. Let $t_1$ be the time it takes to travel upstream and $t_2$ be the time it takes to travel downstream. Then, we have:

$d=xt_1=(x+3)t_2$

We also know that the distance is the same",Current-Speed Problems,Medium,5
97,"A box contains 20 chocolates, 12 are dark chocolate. What fraction of the chocolates are not dark chocolate?",2/5,"Number of non-dark chocolates = 20 - 12 = 8
Fraction not dark = 8 / 20 = 2/5","Solve the following math problem: A box contains 20 chocolates, 12 are dark chocolate. What fraction of the chocolates are not dark chocolate?
Answer: The total number of chocolates is 20. The number of dark chocolates is 12. Therefore, the number of chocolates that are not dark chocolate is 20 - 12 = 8. The fraction of the chocolates that are not dark chocolate is 8/20 = 2/5. The answer is 2/5.",Fractions,Easy,1
98,A car can travel 300 miles on 10 gallons of gas. How many miles can it travel on 25 gallons?,750 miles,"Miles per gallon = 300 miles / 10 gallons = 30 miles/gallon
Distance = 30 miles/gallon * 25 gallons = 750 miles","Solve the following math problem: A car can travel 300 miles on 10 gallons of gas. How many miles can it travel on 25 gallons?
Answer: To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. We know that the car can travel 300 miles on 10 gallons of gas. Let's represent the number of miles the car can travel on 25 gallons as ""x"". The proportion can be set up as:

300 miles / 10 gallons = x miles / 25 gallons

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

10 * x = 300 * 25

10x = 7500

Dividing both sides of the equation by 10:

x = 750

99,"A restaurant bill is $120. If you want to leave a 15% tip, how much should you leave?",$18,Tip = 15% of $120 = 0.15 * 120 = $18,"Solve the following math problem: A restaurant bill is $120. If you want to leave a 15% tip, how much should you leave?
Answer: To find the amount of the tip, we need to calculate 15% of $120. To do this, we can multiply $120 by 0.15, which gives us $18. Therefore, you should leave a $18 tip. The total amount you should pay, including the tip, is $120 + $18 = $138.",Percentage Problems,Easy,2
100,"A package weighs 8 pounds. If you want to divide it into 4 equal parts, how much does each part weigh?",2 pounds,Weight per part = 8 pounds / 4 = 2 pounds,"Solve the following math problem: A package weighs 8 pounds. If you want to divide it into 4 equal parts, how much does each part weigh?
Answer: To find out how much each part weighs, we need to divide the total weight of the package (8 pounds) by the number of parts (4). 

8 pounds ÷ 4 = 2 pounds

Therefore, each part weighs 2 pounds.

The answer is 2 pounds.",Division,Easy,4
